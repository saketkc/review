Transcription factor binding sites are often hidden in the promoter sequence.
de novo motif discovery tool approaches rely on two approaches

- Identifying binding sites in promoter sequences of co-regulated genes in the same genome
	- Drawback: Co expression does not necessarily imply same binding site
	- QUESTION: Meme simply does EM based estimate for overrepresented sequences

- Using homologous sequences from multiple related species
