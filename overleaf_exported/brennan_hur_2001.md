Whenever we think about gene regulation we think about regulation we think either about differential transcription at the DNA ⇒ RNA level or selective degradation at the protein level. Posttranscriptional regulation occurs through translational efficiency and and in mRNA stabilitiy.

Yeast can have mRNA half-lives between 5 and 60 minutes while for vertebrates it can be antything between 20 min and 24 hours. Some signals will act as mRNA decay signals while others will provide selective stability.

Degradation can either occur in the 5’-3’ idirection processing from the 5’cap or 3’-5’ direction starting with the polyA tail. The signalling can occur in 5’UTR and/or coding sequence and/or 3’UTRs.

3’UTR and stability
===================

Elements that regulate poly(A) lengthening (such as cytoplasmic polydenylation element\[CPE\] and AAUAA\] can potentially regulate mRNA decay

the best studied examples in 3’UTR affecting degradation is that of ARE.(AU Rich elements). Insertion of a few hundreed AU rich elements in the 3’UTR can act as a signal for degradation. However a higher G-C content in 3’UTR will ensure stability.

Often the effect of an ARE is to increase deadenylation. HuR addition will inhibit degradation but no deadenylation in vitro. Overexpression of HuR will thus lead to slower decay of mRNA and not deadenylation.

Cell stress, stimulation and neoplastic transformation all stabilize ARE-containing mRNAs.

ARE classes
-----------

ARE are(were?) classified into three categories based on sequence and decay characteristics:

1.  Class I: Contain 1-3 copies of scattered copies of pentamer AUUUA

2.  Class II: Two overlapping copies of critical nonamer: UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A)

3.  Class III: Lack pentamer, but are U-rich

### Degradation characteristics

Class I and class III exhibit degradation with their 30-60 bp of polyA still remaining

Detectable degradation intermediates of messages containing class II AREs are polyA.

HuR stabilizes mRNA decay
=========================

HuR belongs to the Embryonic LethAl Vision family of RBPS and is ubiquitously expressed. Overexpression of this protein stabilizes messages contaiing class I and class II and to some extent class III AREs.

How?
----

there are two ways to grant stability: slow the process of deadenylation or protect the body from degradation. If huR is overexpressed it will sequester other factors needed for degradation and hence the correct way to test if HuR is actually involved in stability is to do a knockout experiment.

Structure
---------

hur has 3 RNA recognition motif(RRMs). For HuD the ARe recognition seems to be mediated by the first two RRMs while the third RRM3 recognises the polyA tail. A simpler knockout would be to delete RRM3.

HuR is predominantly nuclear. It shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm via a novel shuttling sequence called the HNS, located in the hinge region between its first and second RRM.

Cytoplasmic localisation is induced by stress, correlates with RNA stabilization, and required for cellular differentiation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hur stabilizes both ARE-containing mRNA and the shuttles: hinting that HuR binding might happen in the nucleus and it might follow them to the cytoplasm to provide protection from degrading machinery.

Heat shock is like a stress that leads to stabilization of ARE-rich mRNA. HuR localization in cytoplasm increases following heat shock.

Heat shock causes cytoplasmic localization of HuR (with or without bound mRNA)

Potential unanswered questions
==============================

-   How does HuR recognize AREs?

-   Do RRM1 and RRM2 bind simultaneously to ARE and RRM3 to poly(A)?

-   what exact role does HuR play in nulcear transport of ARE rich mRNAs?

-   hnRNP D promotes mRNA degradation. Does it compete with HuR? Do they have same target sites? hnRNP D causes instantaneous decay so would if it succeeds we would not see any hnRNP binding!
