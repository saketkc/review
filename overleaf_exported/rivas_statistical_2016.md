Functional RNAs can have evolutionary conserved secondary structure.. The way to quanitfy this conservation is to look at pairwise evolutionary covariation. Given an alignment, this tool R-scape produces many simulated null alignments (around 20) and cacluclates a G-test fopr each alignment column pair.

The empirical null distribution of the covariation statistic estimates the probability of obtaining a false positive of null data
